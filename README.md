# lein-miditest
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hyPiRion/lein-miditest.png?branch=master "Build Status")](http://travis-ci.org/hyPiRion/lein-miditest)

A Leiningen plugin to play a midi tone when tests and retests have finished.

## Usage

Since this little plugin only adds midi tones to the `test` and `retest` tasks,
there's not much to do really. As I assume that you would like to add tones to
all tests used in Leiningen: Putting it in your `:user` profile within
`~/.lein/profiles.clj` should do what you want. Put `[lein-miditest "0.1.0"]` in
the `:plugins` vector inside your user profile, and that should be it.

If you've never modified the `~/.lein/profiles.clj` file before, create it and
put the following clojure snippet into it:

```clj
{:user
 {:plugins [[lein-miditest "0.1.0"]]}}
```

If you want to put this into a `project.clj`, every single contributor will have
midi sounds playing whenever they test code with Leiningen. If you want a midi
choir, so be it, but take it into consideration if you want contributors.

That should be everything. `lein-miditest` comes with the task `miditest`, which
would check if the midi system works correctly on your machine: It should play
the french horn and just exit. 

Now you can continue to use `lein test` and `lein retest` as you'd usually do,
but with the sound of a timpani whenever all test succeeds, and the french horn
when one or more fails.
